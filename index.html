    <tr><th>Nature of Feedback</th><td>Patient, Dorese Tolson, is alleging poor quality of care on July 19, 2025, by medical staff and security staff with St. Luke's Monroe Emergency Department. Ms. Tolson stated on July 19, 2025, during a medical emergency, she was transported by ambulance to St. Luke’s Monroe Campus. Ms. Tolson claims that while visibly in distress, she was met with hostility and yelling by the attending physician, Dr. Alyssa Gates. Ms. Tolson claims her requests for Dr. Gates to stop yelling were ignored and escalated her panic. Ms. Tolson claims that she was then subjected to an unsafe and humiliating experience and that staff allegedly failed to intervene or offer trauma-informed care. Ms. Tolson claims she was treated with bias due to prior disclosure of alcohol use, despite no elevated levels of alcohol being present and states that the overall conduct of the staff felt dismissive, retraumatizing, and dehumanizing.

Please see the attached web submission/personal statement from the patient for additional details provided. </td><th>Description of Concern</th><td>(Lenore.Hudak@sluhn.org - 2025-07-29T16:32:02Z)
This was sent to Dr. Favini by Rosalyn.
(Lenore.Hudak@sluhn.org - 2025-07-30T12:01:14Z)
I also emailed Dr. Favini. This was the response.
Spoke with her and sent this to Ros yesterday:

Called her.
She reports she is an alcoholic and relapsed and then had a crisis with Daughter.
She understands she refused to talk at first and made the situation very difficult.
She believes Dr. Gates could have helped her if she just backed off and gave her some time.
She felt Dr. Gates was yelling at her.

I told her I would review the event with Dr Gates.
She will continue to come to St Luke’s and our ER in the Future.
She would rather die than go to LVPocono.
