# 🏀 March Madness Bracket Rules

Welcome to the official tournament scoring system.
This format rewards smart picks, calculated risks, and bold Cinderella calls — without letting chaos completely dominate.

---

# 📋 How It Works

Participants submit a full bracket before the tournament begins.

Points are awarded for each correct game prediction based on:

1. **Round base points**
2. **Cinderella bonus multipliers (for seeds 11+)**

---

# 🧮 Base Points by Round

Each correctly predicted game earns the following base points:

| Round | Description  | Base Points |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 1     | Round of 64  | 1           |
| 2     | Round of 32  | 2           |
| 3     | Sweet 16     | 4           |
| 4     | Elite 8      | 8           |
| 5     | Final Four   | 16          |
| 6     | Championship | 32          |

Points increase exponentially as the tournament progresses.

Later rounds matter more.

# 🌪️ Cinderella Bonus (Seeds 11 and Higher)

Teams seeded **11 or worse (11–16)** qualify as Cinderella teams.

If you correctly predict a Cinderella team to win a game, your points for that game are multiplied as follows:

| Round | Multiplier |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 1     | 1.5×       |
| 2     | 1.75×      |
| 3     | 2×         |
| 4     | 2.25×      |
| 5     | 2.5×       |
| 6     | 2.5×       |

### Example

If you correctly pick an 11-seed to win:

* Sweet 16 → 4 × 2 = **8 points**
* Elite 8 → 8 × 2.25 = **18 points**
* Championship → 32 × 2.5 = **80 points**

Cinderella runs are highly valuable — but not overpowering.

# ✅ Important Notes

* Multipliers only apply if the pick is correct.
* Multipliers apply per game.
* There is no bonus for correctly predicting a team’s seed — only wins matter.
* Once a team loses, no further points can be earned from that team.

# 🏆 Strategy Balance

This scoring system:

✔ Rewards consistency
✔ Rewards smart upsets
✔ Keeps late rounds meaningful
✔ Prevents one wild guess from automatically winning the pool

Chalk brackets can win.
Bold brackets can win.
But reckless chaos won’t dominate.

---

# 🎯 Tiebreaker (Optional)

If total points are tied:

1. Championship game total score prediction (closest wins)
2. Most correct Final Four picks
3. Most correct Elite 8 picks

---

Good luck.

Choose your chaos wisely.
